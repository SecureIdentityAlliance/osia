Notification
------------

See :ref:`annex-interface-notification` for the technical details of this interface.

The subscription & notification process is managed by a middleware and is described
in the following diagram:

.. uml::
    :caption: Subscription & Notification Process
    :scale: 50%

    hide footbox
    participant "Emitter" as PR
    participant "Notification\nEngine" as N
    participant "Subscriber" as CR

    note over PR,N: First step is to create the topic
    PR -> N: create_topic(name)
    activate PR
    activate N
    N --> PR: uuid
    deactivate N
    deactivate PR

    note over N,CR: Then a system can subscribe for events published on that topic

    CR -> N: subscribe(topic,notify_URL)
    activate CR
    activate N
    N --> CR: id
    deactivate CR
    deactivate N

    ... later ...

    note over N,CR: confirm the address before the subscription is active

    N -> CR: notify(message)
    activate N
    activate CR
    CR -> N: confirm(token)
    activate N #FFBBBB
    N --> CR: ok
    deactivate N
    CR --> N: ok
    deactivate CR
    deactivate N

    note over PR,CR: it is now possible to publish notification

    PR -> N: publish(message)
    activate PR
    activate N
    N -> N: store
    N --> PR: ok
    deactivate PR

    ...

    loop subscriptions
      N -> CR: notify(message)
      activate CR
      CR --> N: ok
      deactivate CR
    end
    deactivate N
