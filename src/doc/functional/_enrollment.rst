
Enrollment Services
-------------------

This interface describes enrollment services in the context of an identity system. It is based on
the following principles:

- When enrollment is done in one step, the CreateEnrollment can contain all the data and an additional flag (finalize) to indicate all data was collected.
- During the process, enrollment structure can be updated. Only the data that changed need to be transferred. Data not included is left unchanged on the server. In the following example, the biographic data is not changed.
- Images can be passed by value or reference. When passed by value, they are base64-encoded.
- Existing standards are used whenever possible, for instance preferred image format for biometric data is ISO-19794.

.. admonition:: About documents

    Adding one document or deleting one document implies that:
    
    - The full document list is read (ReadEnrollment)
    - The document list is altered locally to the enrollment client (add or delete)
    - The full document list is sent back using the UpdateEnrollment service

Attributes
""""""""""

The "attributes" parameter used in "read" calls is used to provide a set of
identifiers that limit the amount of data that is returned.
It is often the case that the whole data set is not required, but instead,
a subset of that data.
Where possible, existing standards based identifiers should be used for the
attributes to retrieve.

E.g. For surname/familyname, use OID 2.5.4.4 or id-at-surname.

Some calls may require new attributes to be defined.  E.g. when
retrieving biometric data, the caller may only want the meta data about
that biometric, rather than the actual biometric data.

Transaction ID
""""""""""""""

The ``transactionID`` is a string provided by the client application to identity
the request being submitted. It can be used for tracing and debugging.


Data Model
""""""""""

.. list-table:: Enrolment Data Model
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 25 50 25

    * - Type
      - Description
      - Example(s)

    * - Enrollment
      - The full set of data which are captured for one purpose.
      - N/A

    * - Document Data
      - The documents used as an element of proof for part of the enrollment data.
      - Birth certificate, invoice.

    * - Biometric Data
      - Digital representation of biometric characteristics.
      
        All images can be passed by value (image buffer is in the request) or by reference (the address of the
        image is in the request).
        All images are compliant with ISO 19794. ISO 19794 allows multiple encoding and supports additional
        metadata specific to fingerprint, palmprint, portrait, iris or signature.

        A biometric data can be associated to no image or a partial image if it includes information about
        the missing items (example: one finger may be amputated on a 4 finger image)
      - fingerprint, portrait, iris, signature

    * - Biographic Data
      - A dictionary (list of names and values) giving the biographic data of the identity
      - ``firstName``, ``lastName``, ``dateOfBirth``, etc.

    * - Enrollment Flags
      - a dictionary (list of names and values) for custom flags controlling the enrollment process.
      - maximum time allowed to finish the enrollment, etc.
 
    * - Request Data
      - a dictionary (list of names and values) for data related to the process initiated by the enrollment.
      - type of request, priority of execution, type of credential to produce, etc.

    * - Contextual Data
      - A dictionary (list of names and values) for data related to the enrollment itself
      - ``operatorName``, ``enrollmentDate``, etc.

    * - Attributes
      - Generic name for any information collected during an enrollment.
        Attributes can apply on biographic data, document data, request data, or enrollment flag data.
      - ``firstName``, ``lastName``, ``enrollmentDate``, etc.

    * - Expressions
      - An expression combines an attribute's name, an operator (one of ``<``, ``>``, ``=``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``!=``) and a value.
        It is used in search services.
      - ``firstName=John``
