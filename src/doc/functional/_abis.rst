
Biometrics
----------

This interface describes biometric services in the context of an identity system. It is based on
the following principles:

- It supports only multi-encounter model, meaning that an identity can have multiple set of biometric data,
  one for each encounter.
- It does not expose templates (only images) for CRUD services, with one exception to support
  the use case of credentials with biometrics.
- Images can be passed by value or reference. When passed by value, they are base64-encoded.
- Existing standards are used whenever possible, for instance preferred image format for biometric data is ISO-19794.

.. admonition:: About synchronous and asynchronous processing

    Some services can be very slow depending on the algorithm used, the system workload, etc.
    Services are described so that:

    - If possible, the answer is provided synchronously in the response of the service.
    - If not possible for some reason, a status *PENDING* is returned and the answer, when available, is
      pushed to a callback provided by the client.

    If no callback is provided, this indicates that the client wants a synchronous answer, whatever the time it takes.

    If a callback is provided, this indicates that the client wants an asynchronous answer, even if the result is immediately available.

See :ref:`annex-interface-abis` for the technical details of this interface.

        authentication or verification.
    * - ``algorithm``
      - Specify the type of algorithm to be used.
    * - ``accuracyLevel``

    * - Type
      - Description
      - Example

    * - Gallery
      - A group of persons related by a common purpose, designation, or status.
        A person can belong to multiple galleries.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Person
      - Person who is known to an identity assurance system.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Encounter
      - Event in which the client application interacts with a person resulting in data being
        collected during or about the encounter. An encounter is characterized by an *identifier* and a *type*
        (also called *purpose* in some context).

        An encounter has a status indicating if this encounter is used in the biometric searches. Allowed values
        are ``active`` or ``inactive``.

      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Biographic Data
      - a dictionary (list of names and values) giving the biographic data of interest for the biometric services.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Filters
      - a dictionary (list of names and values or *range* of values) describing the filters during a search.
        Filters can apply on biographic data, contextual data or encounter type.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Biometric Data
      - Digital representation of biometric characteristics.
      
        All images can be passed by value (image buffer is in the request) or by reference (the address of the
        image is in the request).
        All images are compliant with ISO 19794. ISO 19794 allows multiple encoding and supports additional
        metadata specific to fingerprint, palmprint, portrait, iris or signature.

        A biometric data can be associated to no image or a partial image if it includes information about
        the missing items (example: one finger may be amputated on a 4 finger image)
      - fingerprint, portrait, iris, signature

    * - Candidate
      - Information about a candidate found during an identification
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - CandidateScore
      - Detailed information about a candidate found during an identification. It includes
        the score for the biometrics used. It can also be extended with proprietary information to better describe
        the matching result (for instance: rotation needed to align the probe and the candidate)
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Template
      - A computed buffer corresponding to a biometric and allowing the comparison of biometrics.
        A template has a format that can be a standard format or a vendor-specific format.
      - N/A
