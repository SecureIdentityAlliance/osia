Components: Standardized Definition and Scope
---------------------------------------------

OSIA provides seamless interconnection between multiple components part of the identity ecosystem.

The components are defined as follows:

- The *Enrollment* component.

  Enrollment is defined as a system to register biographic and
  biometric data of individuals.

- The *Population Registry* (PR) component.

  Population registry is defined as "an individualized data system, that is, a mechanism of continuous recording,
  or of coordinated linkage, of selected information pertaining to each member of the resident population
  of a country in such a way to provide the possibility of determining up-to-date information concerning
  the size and characteristics of that population at selected time intervals. The population register is
  the product of a continuous process, in which notifications of certain events, which may have been
  recorded originally in different administrative systems, are automatically linked on a current basis.
  A. method and sources of updating should cover all changes so that the characteristics of individuals in the
  register remain current. Because of the nature of a population register, its organization, and also
  its operation, must have a legal basis." [#]_

- The *UIN Generator* component.

  UIN generator is defined as a system to generate and manage unique identifiers.

- The *Automated Biometric Identification System* (ABIS) component.

  An ABIS is defined as a *system to detect
  the identity of an individual when it is unknown, or to verify the individual's identity when it is
  provided, through biometrics*.

- The *Civil Registry* (CR) component.

  Civil registration is defined as "the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence
  and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population, as provided through decree or regulation
  is accordance with the legal requirement in each country.
  Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the documents provided by the law." [#]_

- The *Credential Management System* (CMS) component.

  CMS is defined as a system to manage the production and
  issuance of credentials such as ID Cards, passports, driving licenses, digital ID, etc.

- The *Third Party Services* component.

  This component interfaces with external systems to leverage the identity databases
  for the benefits of individuals.
  It provides services to authenticate, identify, and access identity attributes for use cases such
  as KYC.
  
- The *Digital Credential Issuance & Distribution System*.

  This component is in charge of the issuance and delivery of the digital credentials built from
  the identity databases under the control of the CMS.

Interfaces
----------

This chapter describes the following interfaces:

- Notification

  A set of services to manage notifications for different types of events as for instance birth and death.

- Data access

  A set of services to access data.

  The design is based on the following assumptions:

  #. All persons recorded in a registry have a UIN. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
     Please note that the UIN is the same throughout all registries (see Chapter 3 - Security & Privacy).
  #. The registries (civil, population, or other) are considered as centralized systems that are connected.
     If one registry is architectured in a decentralized way, one of its component must be centralized, connected to the network, 
     and in charge of the exchanges with the other registries.
  #. Since the registries are customized for each business needs, dictionaries must be explicitly defined to describe the attributes, 
     the event types, and the document types. See Data Access for samples of those dictionaries.
  #. The relationship parent/child is not mandatory in the population registry. A population registry implementation may manage this 
     relationship or may ignore it and rely on the civil registry to manage it.
  #. All persons are stored in the population registry. There is no record in the civil registry that is not also in the population registry.

- UIN Management

  A set of services to manage the unique identifier.

-  Enrollment Services

  A set of services to manage biographic and biometric data upon collection.

- Population Registry Services

  A set of services to manage a registry of the population.

- Biometrics

  A set of services to manage biometric data and databases.

- Credential Services

  A set of services to manage credentials, physical and digital.

- ID Usage

  A set of services implemented on top of identity systems to favour third parties consumption of identity data.

The following table describes in detail the interfaces and associated services.

        PR -> PR
        note right: create/update identities
        deactivate PR
    end
  
1. Checks

   When a request is submitted, the CR may run checks against the data available in the PR using:

   - ``matchPersonAttributes``: to check the exactitude of the parents' attributes as known in the PR
   - ``readPersonAttributes``: to get missing data about the parents's identity
   - ``qureyPersonUIN``: to check if the new born is already known to PR or not

   How the CR will process the request in case of data discrepancy is specific to each CR implementation
   and not in the scope of this document.

2. Creation

   The first step after the checks is to generate a new UIN. To do so, the CR requests a new UIN to the PR using generateUIN service.
   At this point the birth registration takes place.
   How the CR will process the birth registration is specific to each CR implementation and not in the scope of this document.
    
3. Notification

   As part of the birth registration, it is the responsibility of the CR to notify other systems, including the PR,
   of this event using:
   
   - ``publish``: to send a *birth* along with the new ``UIN``.
   
   The PR, upon reception of the birth event, will update the identity registry with this new identity using:
    
   - ``readPersonAttributes``: to get the attributes of interest to the PR for the parents if relevant and the new child.

Death Use Case

        note right: update identity
    end

    CR -> notifier: full death certificate available
    deactivate PR
    deactivate CR
    destroy notifier

1. Subject identification checks

   When a death notification is submitted by an authorized party, the CR shall run checks against the data available in the PR using:

   - ``matchPersonAttributes``: to check the exactitude of the subject's attributes as known in the PR
   - ``readPersonAttributes``: to get missing data about the subject's identity that 
   - ``queryPersonUIN``: to check if the person is already known to PR or not

   How the CR will process the request in case of data discrepancy is specific to each CR implementation
   and not in the scope of this document. The CR may implement an internal procedure to create a valid PR record retrospectively.

2. Notification creation

   The first step after the identity checks is to notify the life event status to the PR based on an identified record.
   At this point the death notification is recorded by not finally registered. Most states implement a waiting period.
   How the CR will process the death notification is specific to each CR implementation - a provisional certificate is possible.

3. Final registration

   When the PR finalizes the status of the subject's person record then the CR may publish this information at its discretion.
   The PR may maintain a list of interested parties who shall be informed of any finalized death status.
   A final certificate of death including the context of this event is typically issued by the CR to the notifier for distribution.

Deduplication Use Case
""""""""""""""""""""""

During the lifetime of a registry, it is possible that duplicates are detected. This can happen for instance
after the addition of biometrics in the system. When a registry considers that two records are actually the same
and decides to merge them, a notification must be sent.

How the target of the notification should react is specific to each subsystem.

ID Card Request Use Case (1)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

An ID card is one type of credential. The procedures surrounding credential issuance may involve
several sub-systems that contribute to the establishment of the applicant identity and the required data for the type of credential.

This use case assumes a simple starting scenario where the identity is known and can be validated,
mostly with data available from a Civil or Population Registry based Identity Provider.
These use cases also assume the use of a Credentials Management System (CMS) responsible for the
technical personalization and lifecycle management of a credential such as an ID card.

The use case aims to show how a selection of the CMS API calls can support a typical, use case in relation to CMS usage.

    deactivate CR
    destroy citizen

1. Identity Checks

   The example scenario assumes a credential provider service such as an ID card provider (National ID, Voter, &c).
   Such as service may access several OSIA API based components to establish an ID check. In this example the Population Register is used.
   This example case also assumes that the credential provider holds its own register of credentials issued to its subscribers.

2. Suspend Credential

   In the example above the citizen has lost a card and requests a replacement. The credential provider service
   first establishes the legitimacy of the citizen identity and the identity of the lost document within its own register.
   The next likely step in such a use case is to suspend the current credential. This is done using a CMS API call.
   The CMS confirms this step with a reference. In some use cases the reported lost credential may be cancelled immediately,
   but this is typically a decision made by the policy of the credential provider. There is an OSIA API call to both either or both requirements to the CMS.

3. Requesting a New Credential

   The credential provider is in this example case responsible for preparing the core document data for the CMS.
   The CMS itself may further process this data appropriate to the credential type: for example the CMS may be
   the service that signs this document data electronically.
   The CMS returns a new request ID to the credential provider service which will enable the provider to query credential production status within the CMS domain.
  
   Such a business process might be interrupted by an new event such as the citizen finding her lost card and
   wishing to cancel the replacement order, perhaps to avoid a replacement fee. Depending on the status returned
   by the CMS to the credential provider then the credential provider service will act accordingly in informing
   the citizen whether this is possible. In this case the citizen's card was already replaced by the CMS so the
   original card is now cancelled. 
  
   The CMS on its side is responsible for maintaining a credential profile which can be accessed by the CR at a later point.
   This use case stops for CMS when the card is distributed to the CR for collection by the citizen.


ID Card Request Use Case (2)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A second ID Request use case shows how the CMS might expose more decisions to the credential providing service.
In this case it is the citizen facing provider that controls the cancellation of the lost document,
and this is not automated within the CMS component.

    note right: message to citizen by Service Provider

    citizen -> CR: card collection
    deactivate CR
    destroy citizen

This second example shows how APIs may be used to flex the control over functions such as credential
lifecycle management. This example first makes use of the API to suspend a credential pending
production of a replacement; then a second API call is made to the CMS to instruct cancellation of the lost document.

Credentials Issuance Use Case
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This use case describes an example of interaction between the different OSIA components
to capture identity data, generate a UIN, process the identity data and issue both a 
physical and digital credential.

This use case also demonstrates what a middleware could do when connected to multiple OSIA compatible systems.
In this example the middleware is acting as an enrollment server, scheduling all the processing when
the data collection is finalized.

This use case was implemented for demonstrating OSIA and is presented in this `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8mWKxIOiaE>`_.

The main steps are:

#. The citizen interacts with the enrollment station to provide the biographic data, the supporting document
   images, a portrait and a set of fingerprints.
#. When all the data is collected, the full data set if pushed to the middleware using the OSIA ``createEnrollment`` service.
#. Backend processing includes:

   - interactions with the population registry to generate a UIN and insert the collected data,
   - interaction with the ABIS to insert the face and fingerprints,
   - interactions with multiple Credential Management System to request the issuance of different types of credentials.

1. Use case objective

   This use case allows a telco operator to check a citizenâ€™s ID document and identity.
   
   The use case relies on an IDMS to check the authenticity and validity of the ID document
   presented by the citizen, then to check that he actually is the holder of the document.

2. Pre-conditions

   The citizen is registered in the IDMS and has a UIN.
   
   The citizen has a valid ID document.
   
   The citizen presents as a customer to the agent.
   
   The IDMS should support authentication token generation to protect against misusage of UIN.

3. Use case description

   The customer shows his ID document to the Agent. The Agent inputs (possibly by reading an MRZ on the document)
   the UIN, document ID, name, given name, DOB, and a live facial portrait taken of the citizen.
   
   The telco server calls an IDMS API to check if the information of the ID document is coherent and if the document is still valid.
   
   The telco server calls an IDMS API to get meta data of the document such as the issuing agency, the issuing date, expiration date, etc.
   
   The telco server calls an IDMS API to check if the customer is actually the holder of the document using his live biometric portrait.
   
   The telco server calls an IDMS API to get some reliable data of the customer in order to register him.

4. Result

   The citizen is now identified, authenticated and registered in a customer database and becomes eligible to buy a SIM card.
   
   The telco operator can prove regulatory controls have been applied for 'Know Your Customer' compliance.


Telco Customer Enrollment with no ID document
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A customer applying for a new network SIM card may not be able to present an ID document as part of her application.

1. Use case objective

   This use case allows a telco operator to check a citizenâ€™s identity and get his attributes
   relying on IDMS to check that the biometrics of the citizen matches with his UIN.

2. Pre-conditions

   The citizen is registered in the IDMS and has a UIN.
   
   The citizen biometrics are registered and associated to his UIN.
   
   The citizen presents as a customer to the agent.
   
   The IDMS should support authentication token generation to protect against misusage of UIN.

3. Use case description

   The Agent inputs the citizenâ€™s UIN, Name, 1st Name, DOB and takes a live photo portrait of the customer.
   
   The telco server calls an IDMS API to check if the customer is actually the citizen corresponding to
   the given UIN thanks to his live portrait (face biometric matching).
   
   The telco server calls an IDMS API to get some reliable data of the customer in order to register him.

4. Result

   The citizen is now identified, authenticated and registered in a customer database and becomes eligible to buy a SIM card.
   
   The telco operator can prove regulatory controls have been applied for 'Know Your Customer' compliance.
