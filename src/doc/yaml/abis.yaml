      - Mark the encounterId as readOnly, add it to biometricData
      - Add mimeType, template, templateRef, templateFormat to biometricData
      - rename scoreList to scores in identification result
      - Do not mix fixed properties and additional properties, use a subobject for the additional properties
      - Add quality, qualityFormat, algorithm, vendor fields to biometricData
